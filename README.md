# Emotion Perception in Synthetic Speech: The Influence of Pitch and Semantics

## About The Project
Emotions in speech are shaped by prosody, such as pitch, and semantic sentiment, which defines the emotional tone of content. This project examines the interaction between these factors to understand their influence on emotion perception in synthetic speech.

## Key Hypotheses:
1. Higher pitch conveys happiness, even when semantic content is negative.
2. Lower pitch conveys sadness, irrespective of semantic meaning.
3. High pitch and neutral sentiment convey happiness.
4. Low pitch and neutral sentiment convey sadness.

## Objectives
- Investigate the impact of pitch and semantic sentiment on emotional perception.
- Isolate pitch as a critical factor using the SoToSpeak interface.

## Methodology
### Experiment Design
- **Within-subjects design** with six conditions:
  - Combinations of high/low pitch and positive/neutral/negative semantics.
- Participants classified perceived emotions (happy, sad, neutral) and optionally chose additional descriptors.

### Speech Samples
Generated using the SoToSpeak interface:
- **Positive:** "She won the lottery yesterday."
- **Neutral:** "I’ll be here tomorrow."
- **Negative:** "He lost a huge sum of money."

### Analysis
- Responses analyzed using repeated-measures ANOVA.
- Additional descriptive analysis of optional responses.

## Results
Pending final analysis, the project aims to:
- Identify patterns in emotional perception tied to pitch and semantics.
- Confirm or refute the hypothesis that pitch independently influences emotion classification.
